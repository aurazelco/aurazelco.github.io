Hi,
I am *pharmaceutical chemist* with a background in molecular biology, neuroscience and immunology. Now, I am changing field again, and want to pursue a career in bioinformatics! Thus, I am attending the [Bioinformatics Master at Lund University](https://www.biology.lu.se/education/masters-degree-programmes/masters-programme-bioinformatics).  

Ideally, I would like to combine my previous knowledge of *neuroscience and immunology* with *NGS* tools to answer relevant biological questions for the patients.
