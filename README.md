## Aura Zelco Repo

Hi,
I am pharmaceutical chemist with a background in molecular biology, neuroscience and immunology. Now, I am changing field again, and want to puruse a career in bioinformatics!

Ideally, I would like to combine my previous knowledge of neuroscience and immunology with genomics tools to answer relevant biological questions for the patients.
