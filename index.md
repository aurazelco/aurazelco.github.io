Hi,
I am _pharmaceutical chemist_ with a background in molecular biology. Now, I am changing field again, and want to pursue a career in bioinformatics! Thus, I am attending the [Bioinformatics Master at Lund University](https://www.biology.lu.se/education/masters-degree-programmes/masters-programme-bioinformatics). 

I have previous experince with perinatal neuroscience and immunology, namely in the context of _preterm brain injury_. 

Ideally, I would like to combine my previous knowledge of _neuroscience_ and _immunology_ with _NGS_ tools to answer relevant biological questions for the patients.
